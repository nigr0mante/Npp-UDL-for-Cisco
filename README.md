# Npp-UDL-for-Cisco
User Defined Lenguage to define syntax highlighting on Notepad++, for Cisco IOS configs


You have to put the .xml file on the %appdata%\Roaming\Notepad++\userDefineLangs folder and restart Npp. My version is prepared to apply directly over files with .cisco and .ios extensions.
